# Gate-Control
Automatic Gate Controller Software

This software (written in Python) is designed to control double swing driveway gates. So the inputs are 4 limit switches (2 closed and 2 open) and a remote and outputs are 4 gate control activators (left forward, left reverse, right forward and right reverse). The gates swing open when a remote is pressed and (if left unattended), reach the open position remain open for 10 seconds and then close. Whilst the gates are opening or closing, the user can stop motion by pressing the remote. A subsequent remote press will continue gate operation in the reverse direction. 

Whilst this program does indeed control "real world" gates, the recommended circuit environment for any interested programmer is simply a breadboard with LEDs to represent gate motors and push button switche(s) or remotely operated relays to represent limit switches and a gate remote. This is also the original development environment for this gate control software - explicitly an "Explorer Hat" for Raspberry Pi 3 and a dual channel remotely operated relay set. The author cannot take any responsibility for any user taking the "next step" into the world of actual mains connnected motors - all safety and regulatory requirements are strictly the user's responsibility and absolutely  "at own risk". In the same breath the author will certainly welcome any suggestions for improving the operational safety of the software.
